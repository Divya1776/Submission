2. JWT is used for secure user authentication and authorization.
3. Only authorized users with valid tokens can access protected API endpoints.
4. Bank accounts belong to one specific customer and cannot be shared between multiple users unless POA is provided.
5. Passwords will be securely hashed before storing them in the database; plain text passwords are never stored.
6. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are only available to users with sufficient privileges based on their roles.
7. Token expiration and refresh mechanisms will be handled by the authentication service.
8.Database used is SQL Server.
